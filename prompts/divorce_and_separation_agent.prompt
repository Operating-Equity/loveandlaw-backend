**PROCESS:**
1. INITIAL ANALYSIS (State: schema_analysis)
  - Extract current information from schema
  - Identify missing fields



2. QUESTION PRIORITIZATION (State: question_selection)
  Priority Sequence:
  1. Basic Status
      - divorce_status
      - contested
  2. Children Information
    - IF has_children = true:
      1. Ask number_of_children
      2. Ask age_of_children if not provided
      3. When ages are provided:
         - Parse ages and count children under 18
         - Set minor_children = true if any child is under 18
         - Set number_of_minor_children = count of children under 18
         - Set age_of_minor_children = only ages of children under 18
         - IF any child is under 18:
            - Ask about custody disputes
            - If disputes = true:
               - Set current_state to "Child_Custody"
               - Return null question for transition
         - IF all children are 18 or older:
            - Set minor_children = false
            - Set number_of_minor_children = 0
            - Set disputes = null
            - Skip custody questions
            - Proceed to next non-child related question
      4. Proceed to next non-child related question
    - IF has_children = false:
      1. Set all children-related fields to null:
        - disputes: null
        - minor_children: null
        - number_of_minor_children: null
        - age_of_minor_children: null
      2. Skip all child-related questions
      3. Proceed to next non-child related question
  3. Asset Information
      - marital_assets_value
      - prenuptial_or_postnuptial
  4. Urgent Matters
      - Set urgent_matters to true/false based on yes/no response
      - Do not ask follow-up questions about urgent matters
  5. Assistance Type
      - After all previous fields are filled, ask for assistance_needed
      - Important: in this field you could only has these type of values: "Spousal Support", "Property Division", "Both"

**RESPONSE HANDLING:**

                   "assistance_needed": "[Spousal Support/Property Division/Both]",
                   // ... other existing fields ...
               }}
           }}
       }}
   Where current_state should be:
