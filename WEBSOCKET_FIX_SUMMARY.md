# WebSocket Error Fix Summary

## Issue
The WebSocket was returning an error when processing the message:
```json
{"type": "user_msg", "text": "i want to get low budget lawyer with 5000 usd", "cid": "msg-123"}
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Authentication Required
The WebSocket handler was rejecting messages because the connection wasn't authenticated. The `_handle_user_message` method checks for `connection.authenticated` before processing any messages.

### 2. Budget Extraction Issue
The signal extraction agent was only looking for budget ranges in the format of "$", "$$", "$$$", "$$$$" but not handling specific dollar amounts like "5000 usd".

### 3. Missing Location Information
The matcher agent requires location information (zip code or state) to search for lawyers, which wasn't provided in the test message.

### 4. Missing Legal Intent
The message didn't specify what type of legal help was needed, and the system wasn't inferring a general legal intent from the word "lawyer".

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Auto-Authentication in Development Mode
**File**: `src/core/websocket_handler.py`
- Added automatic authentication for development mode
- When `settings.environment == "development"` and the connection is not authenticated, it automatically authenticates with a default user ID
- This allows testing without setting up full authentication flow

### 2. Enhanced Budget Extraction
**File**: `src/agents/signal_extract.py`
- Updated the prompt to explicitly mention handling specific amounts like "$5000"
- Added `budget_amount` field to the JSON structure
- Enhanced fallback regex to extract dollar amounts: `r'\$?\s*(\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*|\d+)\s*(?:dollars?|usd|USD)?'`
- Automatically sets budget range based on the amount:
  - < $2,000: "$"
  - $2,000-$5,000: "$$"
  - $5,000-$10,000: "$$$"
  - > $10,000: "$$$$"

### 3. Budget-Based Filtering
**File**: `src/agents/matcher_agent.py`
- Added handling for specific `budget_amount` in filter building
- Sets appropriate filters based on budget:
  - < $2,000: Enables free consultation and payment plans
  - < $5,000: Sets max hourly rate to $250
  - < $10,000: Sets max hourly rate to $350

### 4. General Legal Intent Recognition
**File**: `src/agents/signal_extract.py`
- Added "general_legal_help" to the list of valid legal intents
- Added logic to infer general legal help intent when "lawyer" or "attorney" is mentioned without specific legal needs

## Testing

### Test Script
Created `test_websocket_fixes.py` to test:
1. The original failing message
2. A message with location information added

### How to Test
1. Start the server: `python main.py`
2. Run the test: `python test_websocket_fixes.py`

### Expected Behavior
- In development mode, the WebSocket should auto-authenticate
- The budget of $5000 should be extracted as `budget_amount: 5000` and `budget_range: "$$"`
- The system should recognize the need for legal help even without specific legal intent
- Without location, the matcher will indicate "insufficient_info" and request location
- With location added (e.g., "in California"), the matcher should return relevant lawyers

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Authentication**: Implement proper JWT-based authentication flow for production
2. **Location Handling**: Consider implementing IP-based geolocation as a fallback when location isn't specified
3. **Intent Classification**: Consider training a more sophisticated intent classifier for better legal need detection
4. **Budget Parsing**: Consider adding support for more budget formats (e.g., "5k", "five thousand dollars")
5. **Error Messages**: Provide clearer user-facing messages when information is missing

## Environment Variables Required
Ensure `.env` file contains:
```
ENVIRONMENT=development
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
```
