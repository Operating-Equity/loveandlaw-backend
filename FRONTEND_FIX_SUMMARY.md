# Frontend Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Lawyer Suggestions Not Appearing
**Problem**: Lawyer cards were being generated but not sent to frontend.

**Fix**: 
- Fixed serialization issue where LawyerCard objects weren't converted to dictionaries
- Removed turn count restriction that prevented lawyer matching on first turn
- Added proper logging to track lawyer card flow

**Result**: When users ask for lawyers (e.g., "I need a divorce lawyer in Chicago"), lawyer cards will now be properly returned in the WebSocket response.

### 2. ✅ Suggestions Repeating
**Problem**: Same suggestions appeared across different chat messages.

**Fix**:
- Added `shown_suggestions` tracking to ConversationState
- Modified advisor agent to check suggestion history before generating new ones
- Created suggestion pools with variety for different contexts
- WebSocket handler now tracks shown suggestions per conversation

**Result**: Each turn will show different, contextually appropriate suggestions without repetition.

### 3. ✅ Distress Score Issues
**Problem**: Distress score decreased when users provided factual information.

**Fix**:
- Added baseline distress score of 2.0 for all family law users
- Updated LLM prompt to consider family law context
- Enforced minimum score in calculations

**Result**: Distress scores now properly reflect that users seeking family law help have baseline stress.

### 4. ✅ Location Request Message Type
**Problem**: No way to prompt users to select location on map.

**New Feature**:
- Added `location_request` message type to WebSocket protocol
- Advisor agent detects when location is needed for lawyer matching
- Sends specific message type to trigger map display in frontend

**WebSocket Message Format**:
```json
{
  "type": "location_request",
  "cid": "conversation-id",
  "message": "To find lawyers near you, please select your location on the map or enter your city/state."
}
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
python test_frontend_fixes.py
```

## WebSocket Protocol Updates

### New Message Types
1. `location_request` - Prompts user to select location on map
2. `reflection` - Already existed but now properly sent

### Updated Response Flow
1. AI chunks sent as before
2. Lawyer cards sent if available and distress < 7
3. Location request sent if location needed
4. Suggestions sent (with variety)
5. Reflection prompts if appropriate

## Frontend Action Items

1. **Handle `location_request` message type**:
   - Display map interface when received
   - Allow user to select location
   - Send location back as regular user message

2. **Test lawyer card display**:
   - Cards should now appear when users ask for lawyers
   - Test with phrases like "I need a lawyer" or "Find lawyers near me"

3. **Verify suggestion variety**:
   - Suggestions should change between messages
   - No repetition in consecutive turns

4. **Monitor distress scores**:
   - Should see baseline of 2.0+ for all users
   - Higher scores for emotional messages

## API Improvements Still Needed

### 5. ⏳ AI Response Quality & Formatting
This requires prompt engineering and testing. Current responses are functional but can be improved for:
- Better formatting (paragraphs, lists)
- More natural conversation flow
- Clearer legal guidance

### 6. ⏳ Email/Password from Clerk
The user profile API structure is ready. To add Clerk data:
- Frontend should pass email from Clerk when creating/updating profiles
- Backend will store and return in GET /api/v1/profile/{user_id}

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes using the provided test script
2. Implement location_request handling in frontend
3. Test with real conversations to verify improvements
4. Report any remaining issues or edge cases
