## Current Status üìä

### What's Working ‚úÖ

- All core therapeutic agents implemented and integrated
- WebSocket chat with real-time streaming
- PII redaction with Presidio + LLM fallback
- User profile management with emotional tracking
- Lawyer matching with personalization
- Legal research capabilities
- Redis caching for performance
- Progress tracking with milestone detection and check-in scheduling

### What Needs Setup üîß

- Elasticsearch needs to be running and populated with lawyer data
- Redis needs to be running for caching
- API keys need to be configured in .env
- DynamoDB tables will be created automatically (local mode)

### Known Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Research Agent uses GPT-4 knowledge (can integrate Perplexity/Exa for real-time data)
- Lawyer data is sample data (need real lawyer database)
- No authentication implemented yet (JWT framework ready)
- AWS services not configured (running in local mode)

## Notes

- AWS credentials need to be configured for production deployment
- Consider using AWS Lambda for some agents to reduce costs
- Need to implement proper secret management (AWS Secrets Manager)
- Monitoring and metrics not yet implemented
- Consider adding rate limiting for production

## Environment Setup Required

1. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up local DynamoDB (or configure AWS credentials)
3. Set up local Elasticsearch (or use AWS OpenSearch)
4. Configure environment variables from .env.example

## Testing the Application

1. Start the servers: `python main.py`
2. API will run on port 8000
3. WebSocket server will run on port 8001
4. Use the provided WebSocket message format to test chat functionality
5. REST API endpoints can be tested with curl or Postman
